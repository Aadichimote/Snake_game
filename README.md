Snake Game
    This Python-based Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game built using the Turtle module in Python. The game involves controlling a snake that grows in length as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

Features:
    Snake Movement: Control the snake's direction using arrow keys.
    Food Generation: Randomly generated food for the snake to consume and grow.
    Scoring: Keep track of the score and the highest score achieved.
    Collision Detection: Prevent collisions with walls and the snake's own body.
How to Play:
    Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake.
    Guide the snake to eat the food without running into walls or itself.
    Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, increasing the score.
    The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
